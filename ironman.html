      <h2>Intro of My Hero:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Iron Man, one of Marvel Comics' most iconic superheroes, is the alter
          ego of Tony Stark, a billionaire genius, inventor, and philanthropist.
          Stark, head of Stark Industries, initially thrives as a self-centered
          industrialist profiting from weapons manufacturing. However, his life
          changes drastically when he is injured and captured during a
          demonstration in Afghanistan. With shrapnel threatening his heart,
          Stark is forced to build a weapon for his captors but instead creates
          a miniature Arc Reactor to sustain his life and powers a crude suit of
          armor to escape.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          This harrowing experience inspires Stark to rethink his role in the
          world. Returning home, he shuts down his company’s weapons division
          and dedicates his genius to creating advanced technologies for peace
          and protection. The red-and-gold Iron Man suit becomes his signature,
          boasting repulsor blasts, flight capabilities, and a vast array of
          technological advancements. Each iteration of the suit reflects
          Stark's inventive nature and adaptability, making Iron Man a symbol of
          innovation and resilience.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Throughout his journey, Stark’s evolution from a self-centered playboy
          to a selfless hero is evident. His relationships, particularly with
          Pepper Potts and his Avengers teammates, show his capacity for growth
          and emotional depth. Stark’s ultimate sacrifice in Avengers: Endgame,
          where he wields the Infinity Stones to save the universe, solidifies
          his legacy as a true hero. His final words, “I am Iron Man,” serve as
          a powerful reminder of his journey and resolve.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Best Moment of Tony Stark:</h2>
      <p>
        The best moment that I had felt is the creation of his Arc Reactor of
        vibranium, which solved a major issue of his palladium poisoning and
        symbolized his resilience and genius. This moment in Iron Man 2 showed
        Stark overcoming personal and scientific challenges, guided by his late
        father’s legacy, and taking control of his destiny with groundbreaking
        innovation
      </p>
      <p>Additional moments that also I like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Trapped in captivity, Tony constructs the Mark I armor with limited
          resources, a defining moment showcasing his ingenuity and survival
          instincts.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Stark ends the film with his bold declaration, "I am Iron Man,"
          breaking the traditional secret identity trope and embracing his
          superhero persona publicly.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Stark heroically guides a nuclear missile into space to save the city,
          risking his life and displaying ultimate courage as a team player.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Stark steps into a fatherly role, guiding Peter with tough love while
          encouraging his growth as Spider-Man, showing a softer and more caring
          side.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Stark’s ultimate act of heroism, wielding the Infinity Stones to save
          the universe, is a poignant culmination of his journey, with his final
          words echoing his legacy: "I am Iron Man."
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <p>
        These moments collectively define Iron Man as a superhero who combines
        intelligence, determination, and heart to overcome challenges and
        inspire greatness.
