      <h2>Intro of My Hero:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Thor, the God of Thunder from Norse mythology and Marvel Comics, is a
          heroic Asgardian warrior known for his immense strength, courage, and
          wielding the enchanted hammer Mjolnir. As the son of Odin, the
          All-Father, and heir to the throne of Asgard, Thor embodies the
          qualities of a noble yet flawed hero, constantly striving to protect
          the realms from destruction.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Initially arrogant and impulsive, Thor is banished to Earth by Odin to
          learn humility. Over time, he grows into a selfless protector of the
          Nine Realms. With the help of allies like Jane Foster and the
          Avengers, Thor balances his dual existence as a god and a defender of
          Earth.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Thor's journey is marked by significant challenges, including battles
          against Loki, the destruction of Asgard, and the loss of loved ones.
          His resilience and determination to protect the universe are
          unmatched, culminating in his pivotal role in defeating Thanos in the
          Marvel Cinematic Universe.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h2>The Best Moment of Thor:</h2>
      <p>
        One of Thor's best moments is in *Avengers: Endgame*, when he summons
        both Mjolnir and Stormbreaker during the final battle against Thanos.
        This powerful moment showcases his worthiness and determination to fight
        for what’s right.
      </p>
      <p>Additional moments I admire:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Thor earns back Mjolnir’s worthiness after learning humility and
          protecting the innocent during his exile on Earth.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          His heroic act of summoning lightning and leading Asgardians in the
          Battle of the Bifrost to save Asgard.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Thor’s emotional depth as he reconnects with his mother during the
          time heist in *Avengers: Endgame*, showing his vulnerability and
          growth.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Thor forging Stormbreaker in *Avengers: Infinity War*, an ultimate
          weapon to face Thanos, displaying his determination despite immense
          pain.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Thor’s speech on Asgard’s destruction and his leadership in guiding
          his people to find a new home.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3>Why I Like Him:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Thor’s ability to balance his godly duties with a human touch, showing
          vulnerability and growth.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          His unyielding courage and willingness to sacrifice for the greater
          good, even in the face of loss.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The way he embraces change and learns to lead by example, evolving
          from a reckless prince to a wise king.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          His inspiring attitude, humor, and strength that remind us to face
