      <h2>Intro of My Hero:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Captain America, also known as Steve Rogers, is a symbol of courage,
          honor, and selflessness. Born during the Great Depression, Rogers was
          a frail young man with a strong desire to serve his country during
          World War II. He volunteered for the Super Soldier program and emerged
          as a physically enhanced individual, donning the iconic red, white,
          and blue costume.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Armed with an indestructible Vibranium shield, Captain America leads
          the fight against tyranny. His tactical brilliance, unwavering moral
          compass, and ability to inspire others make him a natural leader.
          Whether fighting Hydra or standing against Thanos, Steve Rogers
          embodies the values of hope, justice, and resilience.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Despite being a soldier, Captain America's battles are not just on the
          battlefield; he often wrestles with personal sacrifices and staying
          true to his values in a complex world. His journey culminates in
          passing the mantle of Captain America to Sam Wilson, symbolizing the
          enduring legacy of heroism.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Best Moment of Steve Rogers:</h2>
      <p>
        One of the defining moments of Captain America's journey was when he
        wielded Mjolnir during the battle against Thanos in *Avengers: Endgame*.
        This act showcased his worthiness and cemented his status as one of the
        greatest heroes in the Marvel universe.
      </p>
      <p>Additional moments that also I like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          His transformation from a frail young man to a Super Soldier in the
          iconic scene where he emerges from the chamber in *Captain America:
          The First Avenger*.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Standing against a corrupted system in *Captain America: The Winter
          Soldier*, proving that integrity is more important than blind loyalty.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Sacrificing himself by crashing the Red Skull’s plane into the Arctic
          to save millions, showcasing his selflessness.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Leading the Avengers in the epic battle against Thanos and shouting
          the iconic line, "Avengers Assemble!"
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          His decision to return the Infinity Stones and choose a peaceful life
          with Peggy Carter, concluding his journey with grace and fulfillment.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <p>
        These moments define Captain America as a hero who fights for what’s
        right, not because it's easy but because it’s necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>Why I like Him:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Steve Rogers is the embodiment of true leadership, always putting the
          needs of others before his own.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          His moral compass never wavers, even when faced with impossible
          choices, making him a role model for integrity and honor.

        <br />
