      <h2>Intro of My Hero:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Spider-Man, Marvel's friendly neighborhood superhero, is the alter ego
          of Peter Parker, a teenager who gains superpowers after being bitten
          by a radioactive spider. With abilities like wall-crawling, super
          strength, agility, and spider sense, Spider-Man is a symbol of
          responsibility and perseverance.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Peter’s story is marked by personal struggles, balancing his superhero
          duties with his everyday life. Despite facing loss and adversity, such
          as the tragic death of Uncle Ben, Peter embraces the mantra, “With
          great power comes great responsibility.”
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          As Spider-Man, Peter battles iconic villains like Green Goblin, Doctor
          Octopus, and Venom while forming alliances with other superheroes,
          including the Avengers. His intelligence and resourcefulness make him
          a beloved hero in the Marvel Universe.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Best Moment of Spider-Man:</h2>
      <p>
        One of Spider-Man's most iconic moments is in *Spider-Man: Homecoming*,
        where he lifts heavy rubble to escape a dangerous situation, showcasing
        his determination and belief in himself.
      </p>
      <p>Additional moments I admire:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Peter’s choice to reject joining the Avengers initially, emphasizing
          his desire to remain a grounded hero for his city.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The emotional scene in *Spider-Man: No Way Home*, where he receives
          guidance from other Spider-Men, reminding him of the value of hope and
          teamwork.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          His battle against Doctor Octopus on the train in *Spider-Man 2*, a
          moment of heroism and sacrifice for the people of New York.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Spider-Man’s iconic upside-down kiss scene, reflecting his human side
          and romantic struggles.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The final swing in any Spider-Man movie, symbolizing his resolve to
          keep fighting for his city, no matter the challenges.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3>Why I Like Him:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>

          extraordinary circumstances.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          His resilience and ability to rise above challenges, no matter how
          daunting they are.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The balance between his humor, intelligence, and bravery, making him a
          well-rounded hero.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          His selflessness and commitment to protecting others, embodying true
